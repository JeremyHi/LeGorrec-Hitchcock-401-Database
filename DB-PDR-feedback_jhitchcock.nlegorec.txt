Nick and Jeremy ---

Very nice work on this document.

On the ERD, you can keep the lines from crossing by moving the
Artist entity down and moving the "selling an" relation up.
....just sayin'....

Make sure you underline the primary keys on your ERD.

Otherwise, an excellent job!

Total: 10% out of 10% which is an A-plus!
